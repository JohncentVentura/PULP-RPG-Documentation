            <p>Project of University of Luzon Pozorrubio Role Playing Game or “PULP RPG” is a free and educational
                game
                for Windows 10 that is exclusive for both campuses that aids the declining enrollment number of
                students
                at the Pozorrubio Satellite Campus. It takes the design of a merged platformer game and a
                role-playing
                game incorporated with learning materials and referencing real life environments where the satellite
                campus is located. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of using a video
                game as
                a promotional tool and also a learning platform to depict to the students the wonders of learning
                through playing. Further, this paper seeks to determine as to which area the students found PULP RPG
                most effective. There are several data gathering tools that was used for collecting the project
                study’s
                data, first is creating open question questionnaires distributed to senior high students by
                coordinating
                with local academies . Second is having a face to face structured interviews portraying the game
                that is
                based on them as a student along with there pique in a game which is both entertaining and academic
                friendly. Third is conducting beta test using platforms such as Discord, surprising the participants
                that the game revolves around the town of Pozorrubio and the school of the satellite campus, along
                with
                their experience playing the game and feedbacks. Data collected in this method were all combined to
                evaluate the effectiveness of PULP RPG as a Game-based learning (GBL) type of gameplay that has
                defined
                learning outcomes.</p>
            <p>This study supports through the findings that PULP RPG is an effective project not just for
                advertising
                the campus, but also as a GBL as it strongly agreed in all of its areas. The game includes a
                game-like
                environment and practice of the learning content through activities like role play, problem solving,
                critical thinking, exploring and quizzes. The concept itself is quite unique according to beta
                testers
                since it is a brand new genre to them to play a game where the protagonist is a student, and the
                gameplay which is a collision of having fun playing a normal game that they can learn along the way.
            </p>
            <p>The project used Agile Game Development since the game employs this method to create small projects
                which
                focus first on developing the foundations or required features of the game that is versatile for
                every
                patch so it can easily cope with the changes along development. University of Luzon administrators
                and
                IT instructors should strongly consider the use and implementation of PULP RPG to promote the campus
                in
                a new way that is a revolutionary move for the university since it is the first of its kind to use a
                video game as a promotional tool, and use both the built game and source codes to apply video games
                as a
                method for learning and can also be an introduction to teach them about game development.</p>

            <p>This section provides the readers the origin and background of the research or project. In particular,
                this also describes the importance of the study, its implications, the reasons for the researchers’
                interest in it, the expected challenges to the researchers and the possible impact it has on specific
                areas such as in school, community, respondents, students and researchers.</p>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Project Context</h3>
                <p>Founded in June 2008, University of Luzon established a new satellite campus which is also known as
                    University of Luzon Pozorrubio Campus with an enrollment of 46 students and counting. It is a clever
                    move for the university as it is expanding its learning grounds to a whole new area with new more
                    students they can teach, and this comes on how they are promoting the new campus. The university
                    does
                    both old and new methods for show casing Pozorrubio Campus which for example is posting tarpaulin in
                    crowded areas so more citizens and potential students can view it, along with its details for the
                    available strands for senior high and available courses for college degrees. It is also available
                    for
                    work immersion for senior high from other schools to also have a preview and experience inside the
                    Pozorrubio Campus. The university also promotes through online by having a website which can be
                    easily
                    be browse and also a search engine where students can research the necessary requirements and
                    available
                    strand or course they will take.</p>
                <p>One of the main idea of this project is to help promote the Pozorrubio Campus in a very unique way,
                    by
                    creating a role-playing game centered around the campus settings. A role-playing game, abbreviated
                    as
                    RPG, is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a certain setting. Players take
                    responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or
                    through a
                    process of structured decision-making regarding character development. Actions taken within many
                    games
                    succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.</p>
                <p>University of Luzon Pozorrubio Campus will benefit from this game as it represents the school, the
                    town
                    and the students as it simulates their situation that makes it more interactive in their
                    perspective.
                    This also helps the campus from its enrollment rate problem where there is a sudden decline number
                    of
                    enrollees over the past few years, especially in the college department when students after they
                    graduate from senior high, they will choose to transfer to other universities instead of continuing
                    their degree to Pozorrubio Campus. Another problem also is the rise of the pandemic which also has a
                    drastic effect on the enrollments of the students, that leads some of them to have a very hard time
                    to
                    decision to either leave or stay. This gives the game the concept of capturing the happenings
                    surrounding the campus.</p>
                <p>The game is called “Project of University of Luzon Pozorrubio Role-Playing Game.” or “PULP RPG” for
                    short. The game objective is to help promote the university and to persuade students to continue
                    there
                    academics in Pozorrubio Campus. It can also be a guide for students who wants to become a game
                    developer
                    someday as they have access to the project as their reference or to modify it themselves. The
                    project
                    can also become a portfolio for applying work in the future, if the portfolio is related somehow to
                    the
                    job description.</p>

            <header>Review of Related Literature</header>
            <p>This chapter presents all cited literature, systems and works found helpful in the development of a game,
                along with the graphic styles and the chronology of how games evolves.</p>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Conceptual Literature</h3>
                <p>This answers some technical questions regarding the world of video games. While there are many genres
                    of video games, almost all of them fall into one of two general graphical styles, 2D or 3D. The
                    basic difference between these is obvious, but there is a lot more to consider when comparing 2D and
                    3D games.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>How games evolves</h3>
                <p>The history of video games began in the 1950s and 1960s as computer scientists began designing simple
                    games and simulations on minicomputers and mainframes. Spacewar! Was developed by MIT student
                    hobbyists in 1962 as one of the first games on a video display. By the mid-1970s, the first ROM
                    cartridge-based home consoles arrived, including the Atari Video Computer System (VCS) and Nintendo
                    consoles. Coupled with rapid growth in a golden age of arcade video games, including Space Invaders
                    and Pac-Man, the home console market also flourished.</p>
                <p>In the early 1990s, introduces optical media via CD-ROMs, and real-time 3D polygonal graphic
                    rendering. Both aspects were readily incorporated into personal computers and creating a market for
                    graphics cards, including Sony’s fledgling PlayStation console line. By the late 1990s, the Internet
                    also gained widespread consumer use, and video games began incorporating online elements. Microsoft
                    entered the console hardware market in the early 2000s with its Xbox line.</p>
                <p>From the 2000s and into the 2010s, the industry has seen a shift of demographics as mobile gaming on
                    smartphones and tablets displaced handheld consoles, and casual gaming had become an increasing
                    larger sector of the market. In 2016, The Oculus Rift is considered the first consumer-ready VR
                    headset. The unit was developed by Palmer Luckey, and first announced in 2013 as an inexpensive VR
                    option for video games.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>What is a 2D video game?</h3>
                <p>2D games use flat graphics, called sprites, and dont have three-dimensional geometry with only two
                    axes of motion. They are drawn to the screen as flat images, where you can move left and right as
                    well as up and down, which means they don’t have as many options for movement. Many 2D games are
                    linear, meaning that your primary objective is simply to get from the start to the end of a level.
                    The camera in 2D games is also greatly simplified. It typically looks straight at the game from the
                    side, so there’s no perspective like in 3D games. Some 2D games use an effect called parallax
                    scrolling, which scrolls the background at a different speed than the foreground to create the
                    illusion of depth.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>What is a 3D video game?</h3>
                <p>3D games usually make use of three-dimensional geometry that include full movement through
                    three-dimensional planes. This means that the player is able to move around in a real world setting
                    where they can turn 360 degrees, and in which objects have length, height, and depth. Models and
                    textures are rendered to create solid environments, characters and objects that make up the game
                    world. 3D games usually render the scene using perspective, so objects appear larger on screen as
                    they get closer to the camera.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>What is Game Development?</h3>
                <p>Game Development is the art of creating games and describes the design, development and release of a
                    game. It may involve concept generation, design, build, test and release. While you create a game,
                    it is important to think about the game mechanics, rewards, player engagement and level design, as
                    well as the tools you will use such as game engines.</p>
                <p>A game engine is a software framework primarily designed for the development of video games, The core
                    functionality typically provided by a game engine may include a rendering engine (“renderer”) for 2D
                    or 3D graphics, a physics engine or collision detection (and collision response), sound, scripting,
                    animation, artificial intelligence, networking, streaming, memory management, threading,
                    localization support, scene graph, and video support for cinematics.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Conceptual Framework</h3>
                <p>The proponents are interested on how students react to the project, formulating a topic that will be
                    discussed with them which the goal is what specific parts of a game mostly affects and satisfies
                    them and are they piqued to play a GBL type of game.</p>

                <h3>Review of Literatures</h3>
                <p>According to Pluralsight (May 04, 2020), “What Makes a Good Video Game? 4 Key Elements”, it stated
                    “Gameplay, Story, Art design & graphic, and Challenge, focusing on those elements is a solid start
                    for any designer looking to know what makes a good video game.” In terms of gameplay, games are
                    meant to be interactive. They are a way for a person to immerse themselves in a different setting or
                    world. Unlike a movie where you're just along for the ride, a game gives the player complete
                    control. If the control is clunky or not fun to play, you won't have a great game. Gameplay should
                    have clear controls and good feedback to the player.</p>
                <p>In terms of of story, According to Kayla Herrera (July 20, 2016), “Why Story Is Especially Important
                    In Today’s Video Games”, she stated that “Having a strong story in a video game makes the gaming
                    experience that much more unforgettable, and it helps players lose theirselves in the game. Kind of
                    like when you lose yourself reading a good book. It's a tranquil kind of oasis where they can
                    imagine for a moment they are the character in the game and can get swept away in their drama or
                    story.” Since the story of the project revolves around a student, it is more relatable for players
                    who are also students since there experience has the same plot which is a key factor that makes a
                    game unforgettable.</p>
                <p>In terms of art design and graphics, According to RocketBrushStudio (December 8, 2021) “Why Pixel Art
                    Games Have Become Widely Popular”, they stated that “Pixel Art games are known for their action
                    platforming and RPG game design solutions that influence the gameplay and create memorable
                    atmosphere. When done properly, the simpler visuals of Pixel Art make it easier for the player to
                    recognize different game elements and can allow a smoother game experience. On the other hand, this
                    simplicity makes it hard to fit many different game elements, so striking the right balance when it
                    comes to the density of elements is key.” Since the project also implements platformer and
                    role-playing gameplay, it is suggested to use Pixel Art as the sole design of the game.</p>
                <p>In terms of challenges, According to Juho Hamari, David Shernoff, Elizabeth Rowe and Brianno Coller
                    (August 2016), they stated in their abstract that “For the design of educational games, the results
                    imply that the challenge of the game should be able to keep up with the learners growing abilities
                    and learning in order to endorse continued learning in game-based learning environments.” Designing
                    a game which is both entertaining and educational is a real test for developers, so the challenge
                    must have a so called learning curve which creates a handicap for players that goes harder along the
                    way, this ensures that the game is not that hard to beat and not that easy to finish.</p>
                <p>The proponents also conducted beta test that shows similar answers on what is the most memorable
                    thing of a video game for them, and added the unique way of the game of implementing both the
                    concepts of a video game and academics. In terms of the questionnares, here are examples of open
                    question which a question will build up to the next question.</p>

                <h3>Variables</h3>
                <p>With all the web articles, scholarly articles, and research the proponents have gone through, it can
                    be determined that there are four main independent variables: Gameplay, Storytelling, Graphics,
                    Challenges. Gameplay since games are meant to be interactive and entertaining, Storytelling makes a
                    game be a way to tell a story in an interactive setting, Graphics since it is what the player sees.
                    Everything from the environments, the characters, and even the lighting all play a role in the look
                    and feel of the game. Challenges so when players complete a level or mission, they want to feel like
                    they had to work for it and like they accomplished something. While the dependent variables is the
                    satisfaction of the players, the moderator variable which is GBL or game-based learning that can
                    alter the effect that an independent variable has on a dependent variable.</p>
                <p>Game-based learning (GBL) is a type of game play that has defined learning outcomes. Generally,
                    game-based learning is designed to balance subject matter with gameplay and the ability of the
                    player to retain, and apply said subject matter to the real world. Children tend to spend hours
                    playing hide and seek, learning the steps of digital games, such as chess, and engaging in creative
                    games. Therefore, it can be said that play and learning are synonymous, leading to cognitive and
                    emotional development inside a social and cultural context. For instance, the game of hide and seek:
                    Good hiders need visual and spatial perspective to define the best hiding places, while seekers must
                    be skilled at searching for cues from the surroundings and choosing the most probable location for
                    the hider among various possible places.</p>

                    Ireland, Marquis Wideman, Zari Case from University of South Carolina Capstone Project. There
                    subject code CSCE 490/492 Capstone Computing Project Class gives them the opportunity to create a
                    game in their own development and design. The main goal of this project is to develop a 2D
                    platformer using the Unity Game Development Engine and as such will be using C# scripts and the
                    Unity Development Environment to create the project.</p>
                <p>Similarly, the project will also be developed using the Unity Game Engine and use C# as its
                    programming langauge which is easy to understand since the language is an object-oriented
                    programming language, additionaly using also a narrative scripting language for its dialogue system.

                <h3>GDAD Program</h3>
                <p>In the fall season of 2020, the 2D Capstone Course in the GDAD Program at the University of Texas at
                    Austin occurs each fall, and challenges students to utilize all their new skills to create a final
                    project. Undergraduates from the Center for Arts and Entertainment Technologies, Computer Science
                    Department, and Radio-Television-Film Department were assigned to developed their own unique 2D
                    video game.
                    All games created in the program are limited in 2D graphics which is the same as the graphic style
                    of PULP RPG as well. Pixel art is one of the easiest yet effective way to create an artwork
                    especially in 2D video games as it is less time consuming and easily can be learned.

                <h3>Hollow</h3>
                <p>In July 2020, a game called “Hollow” which is a 2-D Roguelike Platformer video game was designed and
                    built by four graduate students, Lara Alley, Hazel Arroyo, Mitchell Loewen, and Felipe
                    Simas-Magalhaes as the final capstone project for their MA in Game Design, a joint degree offered by
                    AU’s School of Communication and the College of Arts and Sciences. Capstone projects, which are
                    required to finish the master’s degree, give students the chance to demonstrate what they’ve
                    achieved in two years of intense classroom learning and practice in the AU Game Lab.</p>
                <p>The game combines the elements of roguelike games and platformer games. Roguelike games are
                    characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated levels, turn-based gameplay,
                    grid-based movement. This is also similiar to the project except its alternation of theme of the
                    dungeon or any fantasy-theme concept, which also makes the game a new fresh experience for players

                <p>Maze Escape a 3D puzzle adventure game with logic and random object generation is based on the 2016
                    puzzle adventure game “Inside”. This is a partial fulfillment of the requirements of the subject
                    capstone project in Arellano University Andres Bonifacio Campus Pag-asa St., Caniogan, Pasig City,
                    Philippines. The developers Jhenira I. Jabson, Joshua S. Gabriel, Jezza R. Lorena and Joshua C.
                    Fuentes created the concept of a strategic game wherein you will play as Ricardo a young
                    Archeologist who found a Pyramid. He will enter the pyramid himself to study and collect ancient and
                    rare artifacts. But it will not be easy as Traps and Anubis are luring into the pyramid. Help
                    Ricardo as he collects ancient artifacts, avoid traps and survive Anubis in this puzzle adventure
                    game.</p>
                <p>Puzzle and adventure is also one of the features of the PULP RPG, as it also test the players with
                    their logical thinking to figure out how to fix a problem in the game. The game is also an
                    open-world based so adventuring to the virtual town is also a nostalgic experience for pozorrubian

                    University of the Cordilleras in Baguio City, Philippines. The game mechanics is simple which you
                    need to move tha ball upward while making a swing motion, this shows how complex and sensitive the
                    physics engine of the game that makes it more challenging, the obstacles will try to stop you so the
                    game will reset back, unless you finish crossing all obstacles of the game.</p>
                <p>The game itself has a scoring mechanism and also a good representation of how physics and collision
                    works together. This generates some ideas on creating some gameplay in the project, not to mention

                is suitable for indie game developers. The project is a 2D pixel-based platformer video game created
                using the Unity Game Engine and written in C# and ink, the game mirrors real life places and aspects of
                University of Luzon Pozorrubio Campus and its town, to help promote the campus and encourage students to

                <p>Figure 2. presents the Unity Hub of the project. Unity Hub is a standalone application that
                    streamlines the way users find, download, and manage their Unity Projects and installations. This
                    allows the proponents to create different projects of the same game by only focusing in developing
                    the foundations of the project which will be later be compiled into a bigger project with less
                    errors and bugs since each feature of the game is already developed. Developers can also manage the
                    modules they need for the game, the editor they will install, the licenses they will use and the
                    templates to jump-start the creation process of their game. The project’s Unity Hub is using version

                    Since the project is in 2D, Unity allows importation of sprites and an advanced 2D world renderer
                    which helps the developers import their artworks to the engine. The project’s Unity Editor is using

                    the Pozorrubio Campus, the proponents only use personal licenses for developing the project that
                    causes them not to purchase the paid version of the Unity Game Engine.</p>

                <h3>Unity Asset Store</h3>
                <p>Creators can develop and sell user-generated assets to other game makers via the Unity Asset Store.
                    This includes 3D and 2D assets and environments for developers to buy and sell. This also helps the
                    project for using assets from the Asset Store as placeholders for the game for developing purposes,
                    that later on will be changed when finishing the game.</p>

                <p>Figure 4. presents the Visual Studio Code of the project. Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor
                    that can be used with a variety of available languages which includes basic support for most common
                    programming languages. This basic support includes: Syntax Highlighting (which displays text,
                    especially source code, in different colours and fonts according to the category of terms), Bracket
                    Matching (That highlights matching sets of brackets that helps programmers navigate through the code
                    and also spot any improper matching), Code Folding (is a feature of some graphical user interfaces
                    that allows the user to selectively hide or display parts of a document), Configurable Snippets, and
                    IntelliSense (Code Completion).</p>

                <h3>Unity Script Editor</h3>
                <p>The Unity Game Engine can setup VS Code as Unity Script Editor. Unity has built-in support for
                    opening scripts in Visual Studio Code as an external script editor on Windows and macOS. Unity will
                    detect when Visual Studio Code is selected as an external script editor and pass the correct
                    arguments to it when opening scripts from Unity. For developing this game, the proponents selected
                    using Visual Studio Code over Microsoft Visual Studio although both can be use as Unity Script
                    Editor, it is more proficient to use VS Code since it is more lighter than Visual Studio. VS Code is
                    also free which is good for beginning projects. The project’s Visual Studio Code is using version
                    1.72.2.</p>

                    and features different tools for image and animation editing. The main design purpose of Aseprite is
                    to create animated 2D pixel-art sprites. Some of its features include: Layers and frames (with layer
                    grouping and animation tagging), Pixel-art specific transformations and tools (pixel-perfect modes,
                    custom brushes, etc), Animation real-time preview and onion skinning, Tilemap and tileset modes and
                    Color palette managing (including 67 default palettes).</p>

                <h3>Aseprite Extension</h3>
                <p>Aseprite uses its own binary file type to store data, which is typically saved with .ase or .aseprite
                    extensions. Different third-party projects were developed to support parsing of .ase files including
                    in game engines like Unity and Godot. Since the project is also using the Unity Game Engine, it is
                    also compatible with .ase files, as well as creating artwork in 2D that can be integrated in the
                    project. Upon using Aseprite by the time the project is started, it is free, but recently it is
                    needed to be paid for $17.05. The project’s Aseprite is using version 1.2.15.</p>

                    photo editing software developed by Adobe. The software provides many image editing features for
                    pixel-based images, raster graphics and vector graphics. It uses a layer-based editing system that
                    enables raster image creation and altering with multiple overlays that support transparency. Layers
                    can also act as masks or filters, changing underlying colors. Shadows and other effects can be added
                    to the layers. The project’s Photoshop is using version 14.0 CC.</p>

                <h3>Non-Pixel Artworks</h3>
                <p>Since not all graphics in the project is pixel art based, the proponents use this program for
                    designing the non-pixel artwork of the game. This includes the menu screens, some real life images
                    of the campus and the town, and other digital art works. Several artworks are also used as
                    placeholders for the menu and user interface for developing purposes, by creating a visualization
                    using Photoshop and see what fits in the game itself. Somehow with this project, it is not only
                    promoting the school, but also promotes pixel artist, digital artist and indie game developers.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>This project requires the description of the campus and its surrounding environment and ways on
                    implementing on it a game mechanic which is both educative and entertaining. For this kind of
                    approach to work, the proponents selected the Agile Method, specifically for game development. Agile
                    Game Development is an iterative process. The approach can be interpreted as working on small
                    projects instead of working on the whole project. Its processes breed a flexible, self-organized,
                    fast-paced, and open-minded focus. The focus is then directed towards creating efficient games for
                    their players. This project employs this method to create small projects which focus first on
                    developing the foundations or required features of the game that is versatile for every patch so it
                    can easily cope with the changes of the project. Second is on developing the basic mechanics along
                    with using placeholders to be replaced later on so it will be easy to design the graphics and UI of
                    the game. Third is the level design and scripting of the dialogues, and lastly is to debug major
                    bugs and play with the settings and environment of the game. By doing each project independent on
                    its own and later on compiling it into the actual project, this is a strategy for only focusing
                    first on the crucial part of the game and later on just focus on the gameplay part of the game, in
                    order to focus more for each individual projects rather than focusing on the whole project.</p>
                <p>This also avoid the cause of creating the game in an instance that is not accurate in the data
                    gathered. Apart from Scrum which is one of the best Agile practices, the proponents used Extreme
                    Programming (XP). This is an another agile game development practice. XP focuses more on adapting to
                    the changes noticed on rapid releases of the working game software. It means that the game developer
                    can see what the highest priority feature looks like before designing. Hence, the developer can stir
                    the design towards the most fun feature as quickly as possible. So for each data gathered, it will
                    be compiled to each small project needing the specific data, so the developers can use the data and
                    implement it step by step to use each data effectively. Particularly, the entire process of the
                    development of the game went through formal and logical steps adopted from System Development Life
                    Cycle (SDLC).</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="/Figures/Figure 10. SDLC per feature.png" alt="Figure 10. SDLC per feature">
                    <figcaption>Figure 10. SDLC per feature</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Figure 10. presents the SDLC, so for each feature of the game, it will undergo into four stages
                    before it is implemented in the main project. In planning stage, a feature will be presented and
                    will be evaluated if it is essential or not, whether it can also affect other features and if the
                    time required to develop it can be scheduled. In designing stage, the feature is done being planned
                    and proceeds to designing it, this is very crucial since the feature must be designed to also
                    interact with other features, for instance how the project saves data for each chapter of the game.
                </p>
                <p>Designing also comes along with the coding stage, when designing the feature, it may have its own
                    script depending if the feature needs to be scriptable or not, the code must be feasible to be
                    easily understand and versatile so when it is integrated in the project, it can recycle its codes by
                    changing its serializable variables that can function for different purposes that makes the source
                    code neat and organize. This also helps when finding bugs and errors, as well as in designing since
                    it is just creating templates which are called prefabs in game development that can easily
                    manipulate and place in each scenes of our game. If all of this stages are completed, it can now
                    implement it to our main project and proceed to the next feature.</p>
                <p>The proponents classified the group of features and the phases when they will be developed and
                    implemented in the project. The first group is the foundation of the game which tackles features
                    like the master control, data persistence, user input and user experience, dialogue system and the
                    physics of the game. The second group is the mechanics of the game that contains features like
                    player controls, inventory system, heads-up display the objects that can be interacted. The third
                    group is the level design which explains features like designing of the scenes with tilemaps, quest
                    system, generating UID and the resolution of the game. The fourth and last group is graphics that
                    shows the features such as the animations, parallax backgrounds, tilemap rendering and audio system.
                    Each feature was developed individually and later on implemented and adjusted to other features,
                    until all features are completed for the game to be built and released.</p>

                <p>Figure 22 presents the system architecture of the game, specifically games built in Unity Game
                    Engine. The Player, who is playing the game, will use a keyboard or a controller to input keys that
                    are registered to the input manager engine which is one of the Device API provided by the game
                    engine. This inputs will then proceed to the Game Logic, which reads the inputs and the game will
                    correspond depending on what the keys commands. The game logic is also responsible for sending data
                    to the Graphics Engine and Sound Engine. The Graphic Engine is responsbile for rendering the small
                    resolution pixel art and filter it on how it will render in the monitor without compressing it, the
                    same way on how the sound engine will know what sound it will produce like the BGM (Background
                    Music) and SFX (Sound Effects) renders in the Sound Engine. Both this engines are Device API’s that
                    is responsible for rendering the graphics in the monitor and producing the sound in a speaker. As a
                    bonus, the data persistence is responsbile for saving the data in a directory in the player’s
                    compute to save their progress.</p>

            <p>The proponents have gathered the data required to unravel the statement of the problem that was
                identified by the project. This includes the techniques of the university in promoting the school
                campus, figuring the technology or unique ways that can be used in order to promote the school, and what
                would that particular technology outcome will look when it is release.</p>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>What kind of game can be develop to promote the University of Luzon Pozorrubio Campus?</h3>
                <p>The proponents have conducted an actual interview with the University of Luzon Pozorrubio Campus
                    Administrator, Ma’am Valin Ladylyn Taguinin, who said during the discussion, one of their marketing
                    tactics is showcasing the campus, creating performances and encourages students to enroll in the
                    campus. The administrator also said that the school is also offering scholarships for students who
                    are having a hard time financially. The school is reverting back to normal since the pandemic, thus
                    creating the opportunity to upload activities done by the students to the school page in social
                    media platforms to show how interactive and fun learning in the University of Luzon Pozorrubio
                    Campus.</p>
                <p>Base on this data gathered, the proponents brainstorm to formulate a brand new way to develop the
                    satellite campus, and find that developing a video game is a unique experience for target freshmen
                    and transferees as a promotional tool. The idea is to create a video game that can teach students to
                    solve puzzles, boost memorization, manage resources, encourage to explore, answer questions, and
                    achieve this while playing. According to Hoa P. Nugyen (March 26, 2021), “How to Use Gameplay to
                    Enhance Classroom Learning”, she stated “Using games in teaching can help increase student
                    participation, foster social and emotional learning, and motivate students to take risks. One study
                    of the popular multiple-choice quiz game Kahoot found that it improved students’ attitudes toward
                    learning and boosted their academic scores.”</p>
                <p>Video Games can be used as a tool for learning and having fun at the same time, this gives the
                    proponents the idea to create a video game that not just help students and help the creators, but
                    also help the campus for creating a very unique way of promoting the school, by developing a game
                    base on the campus. According to Mitch Weisburgh & Marianne Malmstrom (January 19, 2016), “How Games
                    Promote Learning”, they stated that “Research shows playing some games is a type of practice, so the
                    more time playing, the greater the gain in skills and knowledge. Time on task is especially highly
                    related to math proficiency. Spatial skills predict achievement in science, technology, engineering,
                    and mathematics. Action video games can enhance spatial skills in a relatively brief period, and the
                    improvement lasts over an extended period of time and is transferable to other spatial tasks.
                    Players of action video games show increased efficiency of neural processing.”. </p>
                <p>The proponents also conducted interviews and questionnaires to senior high students in residing
                    academies in Pozorrubio, asking about how would they feel when they play a game for both learning
                    and enjoyment. The results are all positive, showing how video games can affect any students in
                    different ways, and also in this way, an educational game is appreciated in the target audience that
                    at the same time promotes the school that creates a revolutionary move for University of Luzon
                    Pozorrubio Campus.</p>

                <h3>What technologies or software can be used to develop PULP RPG?</h3>
                <p>For the development of the project, the softwares that will be used must be budget friendly or even
                    free at all, this saves the cost for the proponents as well becoming resourceful for using the
                    available tools that can be use both for academics and in the industry. For the game engine, the
                    proponents selected the Unity Game Engine since it is used worldwide and is one of the most popular
                    cross-platform game engines out there. Its community embodies over 2.5 million registered
                    developers, and is a place where both hobbyists and experienced users can share ideas, ask for
                    advice or browse through documentation. It supports over 25 different platforms, which enables
                    developers to make their game more accessible for the public. Creators have the possibility to
                    deploy on all popular platforms and devices, from Android and iOS to consoles and web plugins,
                    everyone can download their creation, no matter the gadget that they own. Unity gives developers the
                    opportunity to create not only 3D games, but, since November 2013, specialists can design 2D games
                    as well. And as far as mobile gaming goes, Unity dominates more than half of the market, as creators
                    continue to rely on this game engine to build the most successful games. Unity holds the supremacy
                    for AR and VR as well, with over 60% of the developed content. Another great thing about Unity is
                    that it allows anyone that is interested in game creation, to download a free version. Small,
                    independent developers are encouraged to pursue their vision and are provided with various tools and
                    techniques to help make their ideas come to life. For those who are looking for extra features,
                    there is also a Pro Business plan available, that goes for 150 dollars a month, and includes
                    priority customer service. Out of all the game engines out there, Unity is by far the most popular
                    one that is being used today. The perks that it offers, such as the excellent graphics,
                    compatibility with multiple platforms, strong community, and its unique and efficient features, like
                    the play mode option, have made Unity stand out of the crowd.</p>
                <p>For the code editor, the proponents selected Ink and Visual Studio Code over Visual Studio. Ink was
                    developed by Inkle, Ink is a markup language for interactive fiction and a specialised editor inky.
                    The language is available under the open-source MIT license and can be integrated in game engines.
                    On the other code editor, some factors of why Visual Studio Code is chosen is because it is a text
                    editor that offers multiple customisable features in the form of plugins for developers to curate a
                    pretty selective development environment. It is also lightweight and powerful that can be easily
                    installed on any platform. Here are some comparisons between the two softwares and why Visual Studio
                    Code is much preferred.</p>

                </div>
                <p>For the graphics design software, the proponens selected Aseprite since it is very popular and highly
                    recommended program designed for pixel art. Many artists love the streamlined interface and pixel
                    art aesthetic of Aseprite. It’s a lightweight but fully capable program that is extremely easy to
                    learn. It comes with features like onion skinning, the ability to overlay frames before and after
                    the one working on that make animation a breeze, and the timeline itself is very accessible for
                    beginners. Aseprite can also automatically convert fonts to pixel art which is very handy for game
                    development and user interface design. There is a wrapping tool that makes it crazy easy to design
                    tiles so that they repeat on the edges which is a big deal in pixel art. The other photo editing
                    software selected by the proponents is Photoshop since it is the leading software for graphics
                    editing & digital painting that is versatile even for making pixel arts.</p>

                <h3>What are the features of PULP RPG?</h3>
                <p>The features and appearance of the game are categorized to further explain each component and address
                    why it was chosen.</p>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
                <p>Developing a game is actually time consuming and requires specific skills like programming and
                    designing in order to produce an outcome of a game that the players would want to play. According to
                    Mahipal Nehra (October 28, 2020), “Beginner Game Development: What Genres Should You Focus On?”, he
                    stated that “Platformers Mechanic is some of the most beloved video games of all time have been
                    platforming games Classic series like Mario and Sonic as well as modern games like Little Nightmares
                    and It Take Two have all had their roots in the genre. Platforming games are, at their heart, a game
                    that requires players to traverse areas by jumping, running, or otherwise moving across the screen
                    while avoiding obstacles and enemies. They can be as complicated or simple as you like, but no
                    matter what they pose some fun game development puzzles to unlock.”</p>
                <p>Platformer genre is one of the game genres that is feasible to create that offers mechanics such as
                    the player jumping or running in a world in the game. It is also one of the oldest genres of game
                    which makes it familiar to other players and not just the students. Besides the platformer genre,
                    there is also a mix of RPG mechanics. According to Harry Thompson (Spetember 18, 2020), “Distinctive
                    Features Of RPG Games”, he stated that “The distinctive features of role playing games (RPG) are
                    Storyline and Setting, Quests and Exploration in thr Game, Items and Inventory in the Game,
                    Character Attributes and Abilities, and Combat System.”</p>
                <p>For making the project, RPG are mostly based on fantasy genre, so the proponents brainstorm to
                    replicate RPG elements but in a modern style. Quests and Exploration in the Game are depicted as
                    finding items such as computer parts to build a computer or find specific books in a library. Items
                    and Inventory in the Game are shown as items can be bought with cash that are scattered around the
                    world of the game and the inventory menu can have access to the buyed items and choose what of this
                    items can the player equipped. Character Attributes must reflect to a student, which in this case
                    are Fitness, Logic, Creativity, Charisma and Mental Health. This features of the game is also one of
                    the reason why the game title has an “RPG” on it, but not all RPG distinctive features can be shown
                    in the project, such as the Combat System since the game is for educational purposes only.</p>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Graphics Style</h3>
                <p>Aside from selecting what genre the game is, it is also important to consider the graphic style of
                    the game since it represents the visualization of the game and also impacts with the players
                    experience. Pixel Art is widely known for indie game developers as the best option when making the
                    artwork of a game since it can operates in low cost budget, takes less time to create, and sometimes
                    offers nostalgia for older players. According to Syadhan (January 25, 2021), “Why Do Indie
                    Developers Make Pixel Art Games?”, he stated that “The first reason why there are so many indie game
                    devs who use pixel graphics for their games is that they operate on a shoestring budget. To make a
                    3D game, you need at least one 3D modeler and one 3D artist to create digital art. Hiring these
                    professionals will cost significantly more than hiring a pixel artist. Given the limited budget, the
                    developer surely needs to reduce the expenses as much as possible until the release of the game.
                    Another reason is that it takes less time in the production. Making a 2D pixellated game is less
                    demanding to the computer during the production than a 3D game. This leads developers to focus on
                    other aspects instead, such as the storyline and gameplay.” The pixel arts assets are compiled into
                    Sprite Sheets and Tilesets that are implemented in the game engine that will be used as the graphics
                    of the game, considering the low resolution of pixel art, thankfuly the game engine does the job and
                    renders it depending on how the graphics engine was configured.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="/Figures/Figure 25. Example of a sprite sheet used in the game.png"

                    <figcaption>Figure 25. Example of a sprite sheet used in the game</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>For the open world exploration, the backgrounds are also in pixel art style, there are two factors
                    for the open world, the tilesets and the parallax background. Tilesets are used to create maps in
                    pixel based games such as the project, this are made up of uniform grid of square tiles that are
                    used for designing, collision checking and rendering of the world of the game. The parallax
                    background on the other hand creates a parallax scrolling effect. </p>
                <p>According to Sonny Bone (July 17, 2014), “Parallax Scrolling: A Simple, Effective Way to Add Depth to
                    a 2D Game”, he stated that “Parallax is defined as the apparent displacement of an observed object
                    due to a change in the position of the observer. With 2D parallax scrolling, the observer’s position
                    only changes along the x- and y-axes. Only an object’s speed and location will change with the
                    position of the observer, as scaling the object would require a change along the z-axis.”, in other
                    words it is a technique in computer graphics where background images move past the camera more
                    slowly than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene of distance.</p>

                <p>Resource Management comes with the form of collectibles in the game, the player need to collect cash
                    in order buy in-game items as well as proceeding to the next chapter sometimes. There is also the
                    stat system that reflects a student aspirations, this stats will later on help the player while
                    progressing in the story.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Storyboard & Level Design</h3>
                <p>Writing a game story is sophisticated, unlike other media like books, television and films, story
                    telling in games also comes with the player actually interacting in the story, this also creates an
                    atmosphere especially for students willing to enroll at the campus as they play a game that revolves
                    around them, since according to Matthew Farber (March 28, 2014), he stated that “In games, the
                    player makes decisions based on the perspective of someone else. This differs from other more
                    passive media, like film, novels and television, where the viewer is the observer. Giving students
                    an opportunity to reflect on games they've played, while weaving in class content, can add a layer
                    of fun and authenticity!”</p>
                <p>For the level design, the story of the game will progress upon unlocking levels which are called
                    chapters in the game that holds a different story, new mechanic, new items and new or recurring
                    characters. For creating the plot of the story, the player is a graduating student that is doing his
                    or her part in the capstone, until the game concludes and finishes once the player completes their
                    capstone defense in the game. The answers are actually can be found when talking to the characters
                    in the game, which shows you need to be a part of the story in order to continue the story.</p>

            <header>Conclusions</header>
            <p>These are brief, generalized statements deduced from the findings of the study in answer to the general
                problem and each of the specific sub-problems. Each problems will be divided to further addressed the
                conlcusions for each topic.</p>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>What kind of game can be develop to promote the University of Luzon Pozorrubio Campus?</h3>
                <p>The promoting methods used by the university can be described as simple and sometimes identical to
                    other universities, it is also advertised to students that come what may if they can see the
                    promotion either by tarpaulins or the school page. The proponents conclude that using a unique and
                    fresh course of action for promoting the campus will be a huge advantage and a revolutionary move
                    for the university, since it is only one of a kind that will actually use a video game referencing
                    tha campus as a method to promote the university.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>What technologies or software can be used to develop PULP RPG?</h3>
                <p>Video game has become a modern entertainment not just for students, but also applies to any people of
                    certian ages. The proponents will use Unity Game Engine, Unity Hub, Visual Studio Code, Inky,
                    Aseprite and Photoshop since this technology or software was concluded by the propenents as it can
                    make academics and entertainment intertwined using game development, making students discover new
                    ways to learn, promoting the university on its own unique way, and helping the proponents create a
                    project that can be used for future references. The game will also be optimized since not all high
                    end technology can be afforded by students, making the game light weighted and easily be installed,
                    this is a move that actually make the game more playable for any students using any specifications
                    of computer.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>What are the features of the project?</h3>
                <p>The features and appearance of the game are categorized to further explain each component and address
                    why it was chosen.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
                <p>The game will be a mixed of Platformer Genre that encourage players to explore around the game since
                    it is a mechanic of run and jump, this also enhances their reaction time and critical thinking
                    whenever they decide what movement they will make, affect their mental image rotation and spatial
                    reasoning that creates a strong effect on someone's ability to picture the rotation of an object
                    mentally, and creates problem solving skills specially for tracking where they are going and where
                    they should come back to. </p>
                <p>The other mix is the RPG Genre but in a modern style, the player will role-play as a student in the
                    University of Luzon, they will need to manage their resources such as cash and items in-game, as
                    well as aspirations like Fitness, Logic, Creativity, Charisma, and Mental Health that will give them
                    a sense of responsibility for management. The quests will enhance their creativity and detective
                    skills to know where or what to find, read dialogues to gather clues and finish the story by being a
                    part of the story by interacting with the characters in the game. The proponents conclude that the
                    game will be for academic purpose but at the same time produce it by making it entertaining and
                    educating.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Graphics Style</h3>
                <p>Since the game is not profitable and serve as a tool for promoting the campus, the proponents
                    selected Pixel Art since this type of art can be learned easily without spending a cost. Also given
                    the time for creating the project which is five months, it is also a wise decision to use this kind
                    of graphics to create a lot of assets in a very short amount of time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Storyboard & Level Design</h3>
                <p>The game will be divided to chapters that corresponds to the data gathered by the proponents, mixing
                    the data with a bit of imagination and creating it into a reality in a form of a video game. This
                    chapters are portrayede as going to the university, finding parts in the computer laboratory,
                    exploring the campus hallway, exporing the town of Pozorrubio, finding files in the school library,
                    and reaching the higher ups to perform a capstone defense. </p>
                <p>Both the storyboard and the level design are connected, players need to understand what this chapters
                    are all about since as a clue, this holds the answers for the final stage. The proponents conclude
                    this type of storytelling to immerse the players with the story and just enjoy the game while also
                    gaining knowledge and other skills, both for gaming and academics. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="end-section"></div>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Recommendations">
            <header>Recommendations</header>
            <p>Considering the amount of time and the personnels who will develop the game, there are some features that
                is sadly scrapped because of the lack of time or for the lack of experience, the list of recommendations
                are divided to further elaborate the features that did not make to the final launch of the game.</p>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Versions</h3>
                <p>The game target audience are senior high students and upcoming 1st year students, but prior than
                    this, it is quite targeting IT students more as well. The original idea is to include all strands
                    and courses but it was later scrapped during the very early stage since it will require a lot of
                    work to do and might not finish the game on time. This proceeds on making the game where the student
                    is taking bachelor of science in information technology, rather than exploring the other courses,
                    but worry not becaus the project will not entirely focus on the course, but rather the experience of
                    being a student. It is recommended to create a version for each course that can make the project a
                    line of its legacy, a game worth to continue for. There is also a debate if the game will be
                    rendered as 2D or 3D, but given the amount of time to develop the project and also the budget which
                    is none when considering working the game in 2D. The 3D prototype of the game was scrapped since it
                    requires professional skills to create 3D objects and models and may make the project heavy that
                    cannot be supported by low specification computers. It is recommended to recreate this game in 3D if
                    given enough time and if the proponents is proficient in 3D Digital Arts.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>The original gameplay of the game has been change not because of the lack of the time but rather the
                    gameplay is quite repetitive that can make players easily get bored on the long run. The original
                    gameplay is more on an open world adventure with a date system that shows when will the story
                    progress. This was scraped in the early stage since single player games are much appreciated if it
                    is by chapter type of story telling rather than using date system that makes the player wait just to
                    proceed to the next story. It is recommended to create date system but also moves along with
                    chapters, thus creating more chapters of the game.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>URP</h3>
                <p>The Universal Render Pipeline (URP) is a prebuilt Scriptable Render Pipeline, made by Unity. URP is
                    responsible for creating limited real-time lighting needs, but also making tradeoffs with regard to
                    lighting and shading. This makes games more ambient and creates an aesthetic atmosphere experience
                    for players. In return, URP establishes standardization by bringing in restrictions and disabling
                    features that wouldn’t be supported on lower-end devices. In other words, it requires powerful
                    components in the likes of CPU and Graphics card in order for URP to render properly. The proponents
                    decided to drop this feature in order to better optimize the game so that a lot of student can
                    access and play the game even if using a low specification computer. It is recommended to implement
                    URP but only if the devices that will be used for playing the game meets the requirements for
                    running the game. </p>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Platform</h3>
                <p>There are two game engines that was disputed before making the game, Unity Game Engine and Godot Game
                    Engine. Using the Godot Engine will make the game also be playable in Android devices but in the
                    end, Unity Game Engine prevails. The reason is that Unity Game Engine is much more flexible and
                    mostly used in the game development industry, not to mention the proponents who takes this
                    opportunity to make the capstone also a part of their portfolio for future reference. It is
                    recommended to release the game in different platforms since the game can only be launch in Windows
                    OS platform because of the lack of time developing it.</p>

                    the game but can directly open the inside of the project’s folder. This makes the game more
                    convinient and less worries for users who are conscious for what they are using in their computers.

                    for the game that they can click that will load the game for them to play.</p>
